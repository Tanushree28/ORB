## üìù Final Note

The surprising discovery that **0.5x TP multiplier** outperforms traditional 2-3x targets suggests the current market favors quick, high-probability trades over larger swing moves. This is likely due to:
- Increased market volatility and reversals
- Algorithmic trading creating quick spikes
- Choppy, range-bound conditions

**Recommendation**: Start with the 0.5x TP strategy on SPY with 1% risk to validate the approach with your trading style and psychology.
